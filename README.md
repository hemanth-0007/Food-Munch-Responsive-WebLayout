# Todos Application

The TodoList Application is a web-based project that allows users to manage their daily tasks and responsibilities efficiently. It serves as a digital to-do list, empowering users to create, read, modify, and delete tasks, all of which are saved locally in the user's browser using localStorage. The application provides a user-friendly interface that enables seamless task management.

**Key Features:**

1. **Task Creation:** Users can create new tasks by typing the task description into an input field and clicking the "Add" button. The new task will be added to the list of existing tasks.

2. **Local Storage:** The application leverages the browser's localStorage feature to store the user's todo list. This ensures that tasks persist even after the user closes the browser or refreshes the page, providing a seamless user experience.

3. **Task Listing:** All existing tasks are displayed in a neat and organized manner, allowing users to view their entire todo list at a glance. Each task is accompanied by a checkbox, indicating its completion status.

4. **Task Modification:** Users can mark tasks as completed or not completed by toggling the checkbox associated with each task. This functionality helps users keep track of their progress on various tasks.

5. **Task Deletion:** If a task is no longer relevant or completed, users can delete it from the todo list with a simple click of the delete icon next to each task.

6. **User-Friendly Interface:** The application features an intuitive and clean interface that enhances the user experience. Users can easily interact with the application, adding, modifying, or deleting tasks with minimal effort.

**Project Technical Details:**

1. **Front-End:** The front-end of the TodoList Application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML is used to create the structure of the application, CSS is employed to style the user interface, and JavaScript handles the dynamic behavior and interactivity.

2. **Local Storage API:** To achieve local data persistence, the application utilizes the browser's localStorage API. When a user adds, modifies, or deletes a task, the todo list is saved in the browser's localStorage, ensuring that the data persists even after the user closes the browser.

3. **Event Handling:** The application relies on event handling to capture user interactions such as clicking the "Add" button, toggling checkboxes, or clicking the delete icon. Event listeners are used to trigger corresponding functions for each action.

4. **Dynamic DOM Manipulation:** JavaScript is responsible for dynamically updating the DOM (Document Object Model) based on user actions. For example, when a user adds a new task, a new DOM element representing the task is created and appended to the task list container.

5. **Responsive Design:** The application is designed to be responsive, adjusting its layout and appearance based on the user's device screen size. This ensures that users can access and manage their todo list seamlessly on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

In summary, the TodoList Application is a practical project that allows users to organize their tasks effectively. It employs local storage to persistently store the todo list, and users can perform essential operations such as creating, reading, modifying, and deleting tasks. With its user-friendly interface and dynamic functionalities, the application aims to enhance productivity and task management for users.
